# Student-Performance-Analysis-Dashboard-Power-BI-
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing student academic performance using Power BI to uncover meaningful insights and trends. The dashboard helps visualize key performance indicators such as marks, attendance, subject-wise performance, and overall student outcomes.
The goal of this project is to transform raw student data into interactive and easy-to-understand visual reports that support better academic decision-making.

🎯 Objectives
Analyze student performance across different subjects
Identify high-performing and low-performing students
Understand patterns based on attendance and scores
Provide a clear, interactive dashboard for quick insights

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
Power BI – Data visualization and dashboard creation
Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Measures and calculated columns
Excel / CSV (Data Source) – Raw student data

📂 Dataset Description
The dataset includes information such as:
Student ID
Student Name
Subject-wise Marks
Attendance Percentage
Total Score
Performance Category (High / Average / Low)
(Note: This is a sample/academic dataset used for learning and analysis purposes.)

📈 Key Dashboard Features
Overall Performance Summary – Average marks, total students, pass percentage
Subject-wise Analysis – Comparison of student scores across subjects
Attendance vs Performance – Relationship between attendance and marks
Top & Bottom Performers – Identification of high and low achievers
Interactive Filters & Slicers – Dynamic exploration of data

🔑 Key Insights
Students with higher attendance generally perform better academically
Certain subjects show consistent performance gaps
A small group of students contributes significantly to top scores
Early identification of low-performing students is possible through trends
